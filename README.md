# Credit-Default-Analysis

Performed EDA on a credit dataset to find insights and patterns on various factors that define customers who are likely to default and the ones who are likely to repay the loan on time.

In this case study, we applied EDA on a real world business problem and understood the concept of risk analytics that are used in banks and financial services for various security purposes.

### Problem Statement
It is tough for loan providing comapnies to provide loans to people because of their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Taking advantage of this issue, many people can apply for the loan and get approved and then become a defaulter. The aim of this EDA was to find out the various factors among the customers that make them highly likely to default and also find out the customers and their and factors that are likely to repay the loan on time.


When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile including various factors.

There are usually 2 types of risks that are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan on time, then not approving the loan will result in a loss of business to the company.
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.


There can be 2 types of customers :

The client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample.
All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time.


When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client/company:

Approved: The Company has approved loan Application
Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.
Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).
Unused offer/Cancelled: Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process. In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

### Business Objectives
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
